"I am an MA English student working on a thesis titled 'When Machines Mistake Humans: Stylistic Analysis of False Positives in AI Detection'. I need you to write a single-file React web app (using shadcn/ui style) that acts as a 'Stylistic Fingerprint Analyzer' for my research.
The Goal: The app should take a pasted text (e.g., a student essay) or prompt the user to give mutilple files (txt, doc, docx, pdf etc) and analyze the specific linguistic features that trigger false positives in AI detectors.
The Interface & Terminology (Strictly Linguistic Focus): Please avoid computer science jargon. Use the following labels and metrics based on my research framework:
1. Input Area: Label this 'Corpus Input / Text Sample'.
2. Metric 1: Lexical Diversity (Type-Token Ratio): Calculate the richness of vocabulary. Low diversity often triggers AI flags.
3. Metric 2: Syntactic Variety (Burstiness): visualized as a chart showing the length of every sentence in the text. This shows the 'rhythm' of the prose.
4. Metric 3: Interactional Markers (Hyland’s Metadiscourse): Highlight words like 'however,' 'therefore,' 'arguably,' and 'in my opinion.' These show Writer Identity.
5. Metric 4: Sentence Complexity: Count the average words per sentence.
Visualization: Create a dynamic graph titled 'Writer Identity Spectrum' that plots the text's 'Sentence Variation' (Standard Deviation of sentence length).
6. Give options to export the anayisis as docfile, excel file, png file, or pdf file.
Output: Provide the complete code as a single Functional React Component that I can run as an Artifact. It should look like a clean, academic dashboard."
