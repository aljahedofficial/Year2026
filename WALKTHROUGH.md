# Stylistic False Positive Analyzer (SPF Analyzer) - User Walkthrough

## Overview
The **Stylistic False Positive Analyzer (SPF Analyzer)** is a specialized tool designed to help researchers and students identify why their human-written texts might be flagged as AI-generated by detection systems. It analyzes 117+ stylistic features across 6 tiers of complexity to create a detailed "stylistic fingerprint."

## Key Features
- **Tier 1: Core Metrics:** CV (Burstiness), STTR (Diversity), and Metadiscourse Density.
- **Tier 2: Stylometric & Gloss:** Function words, pronouns, and lexical sophistication.
- **Tier 3: Advanced Diversity & Readability:** VOCD-D, MATTR, and academic citation patterns.
- **Tier 4: Syntactic Complexity:** Clause depth, cleft constructions, and passive agent retention.
- **Tier 5: Discourse & Stance:** Hallidayan processes, hedging/boosting, and cohesion.
- **Tier 6: Micro-Syntax:** Adjective ordering, pied-piping, and genitive alternations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (v16 or higher).
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aljahedofficial/Stylistic-False-Positive-Analyzer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stylistic-False-Positive-Analyzer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173/` (or the URL shown in the terminal).

## Using the Dashboard

1. **Input Data**:
   - **Paste Text**: Copy and paste your essay or text into the text area.
   - **Upload Files**: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`. You can batch upload multiple files.

2. **Heuristic Calibration**:
   - Adjust the **CV**, **STTR**, and **MD Density** thresholds using the sliders.
   - These thresholds determine the "Risk Assessment" (High Risk, Borderline, Human-Like).

3. **Dashboard Tab**:
   - **Quick Insight**: Immediate feedback on whether the corpus looks human-like or AI-like.
   - **Corpus Cards**: Averages for all major metrics.
   - **Risk Distribution**: Pie chart showing the percentage of High Risk vs. Human-like files.
   - **Metric Scatterplots**: Visual correlation between Burstiness (CV), Diversity (STTR), and Metadiscourse.
   - **Outlier Table**: Identifies the specific files that are most "AI-like" based on Z-scores.

4. **Export Options**:
   - **CSV/XLSX**: Download the full 117-feature dataset for further statistical analysis (SPSS, R, Python).
   - **Method Snippet**: Auto-generates a paragraph describing the methodology for your thesis/paper.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank Dashboard**: If the dashboard appears blank, ensure you have at least one text loaded. Refresh the page if necessary.
- **"High Risk" Flag**: This means your text has low burstiness (CV), low diversity (STTR), or low metadiscourse. Try adding more sentence variation and "signposting" words (e.g., *however, therefore, notably*).
